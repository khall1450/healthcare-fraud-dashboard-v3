# Scraping Coverage Report

*Auto-generated 2026-04-22 12:12 UTC from `build_scraping_report.py`. Source of truth is live code + data; to edit narrative sections, edit `_scraping_report_template.md`. Feed list, scraper descriptions, and coverage counts are regenerated from `update.py`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, and `data/actions.json`.*

Summary: 23 configured feeds, 18 scrape_* functions.

---

## Dashboard architecture

Three tabs:
1. **Federal Enforcement** — criminal prosecutions + civil FCA settlements (`type` = Criminal Enforcement or Civil Action)
2. **Federal Oversight & Accountability** — everything else in `data/actions.json` (Audits, Reports, Hearings, Administrative Actions, Rule/Regulation, Investigations, Structural/Organizational, Legislation, Presidential Action)
3. **Media Investigations** — third-party investigative journalism in `data/media.json`

All scrapers write to `data/actions.json` (enforcement + oversight share the same file, split by `type`) or `data/media.json`.

Items that pass scraping but fail the HC-keyword / fraud-signal gates go to one of two review queues:
- `data/needs_review.json` — enforcement candidates
- `data/needs_review_oversight.json` — oversight candidates

From those queues, items are either promoted to `actions.json`, rejected (added to `rejected_links`), or stay pending.

## Scheduling

| Workflow | Schedule | File |
|---|---|---|
| Daily Fraud Dashboard Update | Daily 7:17 UTC | `daily-update.yml` |
| Daily Congressional Hearings Update | Daily 9:13 UTC | `hearings-update.yml` |
| Daily Media Investigations Update | Daily 8:42 UTC | `media-update.yml` |
| Weekly News-Source Upgrade Check | Suns 10:07 UTC | `news-source-check.yml` |
| Daily Oversight Update | Daily 8:23 UTC | `oversight-update.yml` |
| Daily Scraping Report Rebuild | Daily 11:31 UTC | `scraping-report.yml` |
| Weekly Landing Page Monitor | Mons 9:43 UTC | `weekly-monitor.yml` |

Times are deliberately off-minute (not `:00` or `:30`) to spread API load. Each workflow auto-commits changes to `main` when results change.

**Also for Congress (not in `FEEDS[]`, runs as a separate workflow):**

- **`scrape_congress_hearings.py`** — standalone pipeline querying the Congress.gov API at `api.congress.gov/v3/committee-meeting/`. Extracts HC-fraud-relevant hearings by title keywords, committee routing (House Oversight, Senate HELP, House E&C, etc.), and witness signals. Auto-commits confident items to `actions.json` as `type=Hearing`; ambiguous items go to a review-queue artifact (not committed, 30-day retention on GitHub Actions).
  - Scheduled daily at **9:13 UTC** via `hearings-update.yml`
  - Requires `CONGRESS_GOV_API_KEY` secret

This is separate from the committee press-release scrapers listed above — a given congressional hearing may produce both a hearing item (from Congress.gov API) and a committee press release (from the committee scraper) with different URLs.

## Cross-cutting mechanics

### Date extraction

`_extract_canonical_date()` in `update.py` extracts a publication date from any scraped detail page via priority chain:
1. `<meta property="article:published_time">` (OpenGraph)
2. JSON-LD `datePublished` (schema.org)
3. `<time datetime="...">` (HTML5)
4. URL path `/YYYY/MM/DD/` pattern
5. HTTP `Last-Modified` header

If none resolve, scraper falls back to body-text regex then `parse_date(strict=False)` which defaults to today and logs a WARNING. Items where the source states only month+year use `YYYY-MM` format and display as "Jun, 2025".

### Tag extraction

`update.py`'s `generate_tags(title, full_text)`:
1. Uses `tag_extractor.extract_tags_with_evidence` (AI anchored extractor with evidence citations) when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set
2. Falls back to `tag_allowlist.auto_tags` (regex matcher) otherwise

**Strict extraction rule**: tags are never inferred from external knowledge — only literal keyword matches or recognized synonyms.

**Boilerplate stripping (`tag_allowlist.strip_boilerplate`)**: before either the AI extractor or the regex matcher runs against body text, known DOJ boilerplate passages are blanked out. This suppresses the false-positive pattern where a pure Medicare DME case gets tagged ACA because the standard Strike Force closing paragraph enumerates "Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act." Patterns stripped:

- Strike Force operational paragraph ("operates in 27 districts…")
- Strike Force historical record ("charged more than X defendants…")
- ACA enforcement-authority sentences ("The Affordable Care Act significantly increased HHS's ability to…")
- CMS suspension-authority + ACA attribution
- Enumeration phrase "including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act"
- Health Care Fraud Unit leadership paragraph
- "An indictment is merely an allegation" disclaimer

**Where it's applied** (defense-in-depth, both paths):

- `update.py` `generate_tags`: regex fallback receives `strip_boilerplate(full_text)` instead of raw text
- `tag_extractor.extract_tags_with_evidence`: the AI receives the stripped text as its INPUT; evidence validation still runs against the ORIGINAL text so cited phrases must match the real source. All five internal fallback paths (no client, API error, JSON parse error, non-array response, AI-returns-zero safety net) also use the stripped body.
- `retag_strict.py` `strict_tags_for`: also applies `strip_boilerplate` before running the regex matcher.

After boilerplate strip, program and area tags both require just 1+ keyword occurrence in the remaining body text. Because boilerplate is removed first, the single-occurrence threshold no longer produces the old false-positive noise.

**AI extractor evidence rule**: for every tag selected, the model must cite a verbatim 8+-word phrase from the source. Each phrase is validated by substring-match against the original text; unmatched phrases are dropped. This means the model cannot hallucinate a tag without real textual grounding.

**Co-apply rules** (applied after extraction):
- `Medicare Advantage` → also `Medicare`
- `Medicaid Managed Care` → also `Medicaid`

### State extraction

`get_state(text, title, link)` in `update.py` (state rule v3, 2026-04-19).

**Meaning**: state = "where the case was prosecuted / where fraud happened," NOT the defendant's home state. Demonyms like "Florida Man" or "Illinois Doctor" are defendant-origin signals and don't count on their own.

**Priority order**:

0. **National-scope guard** — if title OR body matches `nationwide`, `multi-state`, `across the country`, etc., return `None` (no single-state tag for inherently national actions like takedowns)
1. **USAO district from link** (DOJ items only) → primary state. `/usao-ma/` → MA, `/usao-edmi/` → MI, etc. The `extract_usao_state()` helper maps both 2-letter state-code districts and 4-letter district codes (`sdny` → NY, `cdca` → CA).
2. **State-as-party patterns** → append. Matches `"State of X"`, `"the States of X, Y, and Z"`, `"X ex rel"` (qui tam). Handles genuinely multi-state claims.
3. **Non-demonym title state names** → append. "Fraud in Illinois" counts, "Illinois Doctor" does not.
4. **City in title** via `_CITY_TO_STATE` — ONLY when USAO is absent (to avoid noise from incidental cities in USAO-district items). The city match skips `"X County"` so "Raleigh County" (WV) doesn't resolve to Raleigh (NC). Ambiguous cities like Springfield, Portland, Columbia, Oakland, Lancaster, Larchmont, Billings, Reading, Mobile, Ontario, Queens, Corona are intentionally excluded from the dict.
5. **Title demonyms** ("Florida Man", "Illinois Doctor") → append ONLY if corroborated by a non-demonym mention of that state in body text (e.g., "Florida pharmacy", "operated in Florida"). A demonym alone is a weak signal.
6. **Body-text fallback** (longest state-name match) — final fallback if nothing above produced a result.

**Multi-state name collision**: `extract_all_state_names()` iterates longest-first and masks matched spans, so "West Virginia" matches first and "Virginia" doesn't re-match inside the same span.

**Demonym detection**: state name + role noun (`Man, Woman, Doctor, Nurse, Chiropractor, Businessman, Owner, Clinic Operator, Company, …`). Full list in `_DEMONYM_ROLE_WORDS`.

**Output**: state abbreviation, or comma-separated list for multi-state items (e.g., `"GA, CO, SC"` for a joint suit).

### Validation at ingest

- **Agency/domain consistency warning**: WARNING logged if an official item's `link` domain doesn't match the assigned `agency` (e.g., `agency=CMS` with `link=whitehouse.gov`).
- **parse_date fail-loud**: unparseable dates log WARNING and default to today.

### Dedup

Items are deduped against existing `actions.json` by:
- Normalized `link` (lowercase host, strip `www.`, strip trailing slash, drop tracking params)
- Normalized `title` (lowercase, strip non-alphanumeric)
- `_report_ref` (OIG press releases that link to an existing audit-report URL are skipped)

## Review queues

- `data/needs_review.json` — enforcement items scraped but flagged for AI/human review
- `data/needs_review_oversight.json` — oversight items
- `data/needs_review_media.json` — media-tab candidates from Google News RSS awaiting Claude Haiku classification
- `rejected_links` lists in each review file — permanent rejections; the scraper skips these forever

## Known gaps + limitations

- **HHS press room** (`scrape_hhs_press`) is disabled — hhs.gov is behind Akamai Bot Manager which 403s both `requests` and default Playwright. Would need `playwright-stealth` tooling to bypass. HHS-proper items are currently curated manually. In practice most HHS fraud announcements cross-post to CMS (auto-scraped) so the gap is small (~1-2 pure-HHS items/quarter).
- **FDA** RSS feed is disabled — FDA fraud cases mostly surface through DOJ prosecutions which appear via `DOJ-OPA`/`DOJ-USAO`.
- **DOJ-USAO single-page pagination limit**: `scrape_doj_usao` now walks pages 0-4 (normal) / 0-19 (backfill) of `justice.gov/usao/pressreleases`. Prior single-page behavior could miss items published mid-day that scrolled off before the next 7:17 UTC scrape.
- **DOGE actions** are not systematically tracked. Only a handful of items mention DOGE and all are tangential to healthcare-fraud reporting.
- **Bot-blocked sources** — DOJ, GAO, and some committee sites return 200-with-empty-body to plain `requests`. All require Playwright fallback, which makes those scrapers slower but more reliable.

---

## Scraper naming convention

Scrapers that fetch via Python `requests`:
- `scrape_oig`, `scrape_oig_reports`, `scrape_oig_press` (HHS-OIG)
- `scrape_fincen`, `scrape_whitehouse` (Treasury, WH)
- `scrape_senate_judiciary` (Senate)

Scrapers that require Playwright (JS-rendered or bot-blocked):
- `scrape_doj_opa`, `scrape_doj_usao` (DOJ)
- `scrape_cms`, `scrape_cms_fraud_page` (CMS)
- `scrape_h_oversight`, `scrape_energy_commerce`, `scrape_help_committee`, `scrape_ways_means`, `scrape_house_judiciary` (committees)
- `scrape_hhs_press` (disabled)

Standalone pipelines:
- `scrape_congress_hearings.py` — Congress.gov API (requires `CONGRESS_GOV_API_KEY`)
- `retag_existing.py` — re-tag existing items via AI extractor
- `retag_strict.py` — re-tag with strict extraction rules (title + boilerplate-stripped body via `strip_boilerplate()`, 1+ occurrence threshold)
- `check_news_sources.py` — weekly news-sourced upgrade scanner

## Tag allowlist

Program tags (6): Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid Managed Care, TRICARE, ACA
Area tags (23): DME, Hospice, Pharmacy, Genetic Testing, Lab Testing, Telehealth, Home Health, Nursing Home, Medical Devices, Autism/ABA, Wound Care, Adult Day Care, Mental Health, Prenatal Care, Skin Substitutes, Personal Care, Physical Therapy, Assisted Living, Ambulance, Hospital, Addiction Treatment, Opioids, Off-Label

Co-apply rules:
- Medicare Advantage → also Medicare
- Medicaid Managed Care → also Medicaid
