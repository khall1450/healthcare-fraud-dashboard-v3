"""Anchored AI tag extractor for the Healthcare Fraud Dashboard.

The previous tag generator (`tag_allowlist.auto_tags`) was a regex
keyword matcher that produced two systematic problems:

  1. False negatives — phrases that mean "tag X" but don't match the
     literal regex (e.g. "Adderall distribution" → no tag at all).
  2. False positives — overly broad regexes that fired on incidental
     mentions (e.g. "hospital" matched on any press release that says
     "the case was investigated by hospital staff").

The previous AI attempt failed because it asked Claude "what are the
right tags?" — too unconstrained, ~35% wrong. The fix here is
**anchored extraction with required citations**:

  - For each candidate tag, Claude must cite a verbatim phrase from the
    source text as evidence.
  - Every cited phrase is then validated by substring-match against the
    source text. Phrases that don't validate get dropped.
  - The output is therefore always grounded in the source.

Usage:
    from tag_extractor import extract_tags_with_evidence
    tags = extract_tags_with_evidence(client, title, full_text)

If `client` is None or the API call fails, returns the regex fallback
from `tag_allowlist.auto_tags()` so callers always get *some* tags.

    return f"""You are a tag extractor for a healthcare fraud dashboard. Your job is to identify which tags from a fixed allowlist are EXPLICITLY supported by an article's text, and to provide a verbatim citation for each tag you select.

## ALLOWED TAGS

You may ONLY use tags from these two categories. Never invent tags.

PROGRAMS (which payer was defrauded):
{json.dumps(programs)}

VULNERABLE AREAS (which service area was abused):
{json.dumps(areas)}

## RULES

1. **Explicit support only.** A tag must be explicitly supported by the text. Implication, speculation, or "the article is about a clinic that probably also does X" do NOT count.

2. **Verbatim citations.** For every tag you select, cite a verbatim phrase (8+ words long) from the article text as evidence. The phrase must appear in the source EXACTLY as written. Do not paraphrase.

3. **Program tag selection rules:**
   - "Medicare Advantage" applies if MA plans, MA risk adjustment, or MA-specific contracts are mentioned. The general "Medicare" tag does NOT need to also apply unless Medicare FFS is separately discussed.
   - "Medicare" applies to Medicare Part A/B/D, Medicare FFS, or generic Medicare references. Do NOT add Medicare just because Medicare Advantage is mentioned.
   - "Medicaid" applies to Medicaid, Medi-Cal, or CHIP. Add it for ANY Medicaid-related case (including managed-care cases — Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care co-apply).
   - "Medicaid Managed Care" applies when a Medicaid MCO or managed care organization is the payer, when capitation payments or risk adjustment fraud against Medicaid plans are at issue, or when named Medicaid MCOs (Centene, Molina, etc.) are the subject. When this tag applies, also apply "Medicaid".
   - "TRICARE" applies only if TRICARE/CHAMPUS is named.
   - "ACA" applies if Affordable Care Act marketplace, exchange enrollment, or premium tax credits are central to the case.

4. **Area tag selection rules:**
   - "Opioids" requires the case to involve opioids, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, or pill mills. Adderall and stimulants are NOT opioids.
   - "Skin Substitutes" applies to skin grafts, allografts, amniotic membrane products, dehydrated placental products. Usually co-occurs with "Wound Care".
   - "Hospice" requires the fraud or oversight to be about hospice services, not just an offhand mention.
   - "Hospital" requires the fraud or oversight to be about hospital billing, not "investigated by hospital staff" or similar context.
   - "Genetic Testing" requires genetic/genomic test billing, not just lab tests in general.
   - "Telehealth" requires telehealth/telemedicine to be central to the scheme.
   - "DME" applies to durable medical equipment, DMEPOS, wheelchairs, orthotic braces, power mobility devices.
   - "Home Health" / "Nursing Home" / "Assisted Living" / "Adult Day Care" require those specific care settings to be the subject.
   - "Behavioral Health" / "Addiction Treatment" / "Autism/ABA" / "Physical Therapy" / "Prenatal Care" — same pattern, must be the subject.
   - "Wound Care" is broader than Skin Substitutes; applies to any wound care fraud.
   - "Pharmacy" applies to pharmacy billing fraud, compound pharmacy schemes, drug diversion through pharmacies.
   - "Medical Devices" applies to device-makers, implants, device kickbacks (NOT DMEPOS).
   - "Ambulance" applies to ambulance billing fraud or non-emergency transport schemes.
   - "Off-Label" applies to off-label marketing of FDA-approved drugs.

5. **Be conservative.** When in doubt, do not tag. A clean small set of correct tags is better than a noisy large set.

## OUTPUT

Return ONLY a JSON array. No markdown fences, no text outside the array. Each element is an object with two keys:

[
  {{"tag": "Medicare Advantage", "evidence": "verbatim 8+ word phrase from source"}},
  {{"tag": "Wound Care", "evidence": "verbatim 8+ word phrase from source"}}
]

If no tags apply, return an empty array: []
