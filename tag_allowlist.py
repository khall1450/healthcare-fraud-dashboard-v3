two categories of tags:

  1. PROGRAMS  — which payer / program got defrauded

# DOJ boilerplate stripping
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DOJ press releases reliably end with boilerplate paragraphs describing the
# Medicare Fraud Strike Force, ACA enforcement authority, and multi-agency
# partnerships. These paragraphs enumerate programs and fraud types
# generically ("including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act")
# and cause false-positive tags when the press release is about something
# else entirely (a pure Medicare DME scheme gets tagged ACA because the
# boilerplate mentions ACA once).
#
# `strip_boilerplate(text)` blanks out these known-boilerplate passages so
# tag detection only sees substantive case content. Use before running
# `auto_tags` on body text.
#
# Patterns are intentionally specific — they match only well-established
# DOJ boilerplate phrases so legitimate mentions are never removed.
